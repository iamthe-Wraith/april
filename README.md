# april
a simple api that listens for webhooks and reacts to them (maybe sometimes a bit snarky)

## Configuration

To configure a new project:

1. In the project's repo, create a new webhook that points to `https://april.wraithcode.io`
2. Set the webhook to send `application/json` data
3. Set the webhook to send only the push event
